## Western Art Exhibit Project Ideation

The piece I am focusing on is the [**Americanization of California**](https://collections.eiteljorg.org/objects/2002/americanization-of-california?ctx=707a6911553fc7beecc11a1c046482454d89f633&idx=17) piece by Dean Cornwell.

### Project Summary

I appreciated the detail of **Americanization of California** and the way time was used in the piece. Many elements or groups of elements in the piece are related to a period of time in the long process of Americanization.

I would like to create a project that dissects the groups of time-periods and gives more explicit detail to the implicit definitions of this piece.

### Core Webpages

This project would have a handful of relevant pages:

- Home
  - Describe the background for this project
    - The Eiteljorg
    - The Art Piece itself
    - Dean Cornwell
    - Maybe some history on the subject of this piece (California, Americanization of the West)
- Project Purpose
  - This page would be similar to a "Blog Home" page, where I would describe the purpose of this project and link to the different subcategories of this piece
    - Dissecting the piece's time periods
    - Link to different groups of time periods showcased
    - Interactive
      - Links would be groups of subjects
        - For example, clicking/tapping on the bottom right corner of the art piece would
- Subcategory pages
  - This is where each individual time period would shine.
  - Research into the different periods outside the scope of the art piece
    - What California was like at this point
    - Tensions
    - Culture
    - American Sentiment
  - Describe subjects in the piece at these periods
- Other pieces by Cornwell
  - This is part of a rotunda mural series, other pieces could be described, linked to, and explained here

### Design Choices

[The Louvre](https://www.louvre.fr/en)
[Eiteljorg](https://eiteljorg.org/)
[Newfields](https://discovernewfields.org/)

I love the animation and parallax effects these sites use. I also love the use of zoomed-in pieces as backdrops for site content. I would like to use both of these in my site.
