### Project Summary
For this proposed project, I want to focus on the interactivity that is already present in the physical space of this exhibit, and translating that to engaging and informative web experiences. These experiences are meant to get people more connected with and excited about culture related to the **Expressions of Life** exhibit.

### Core Webpages
Here are just a few core webpages I'd like to include for this proposed project:
- Weaving
  - Interactive experience where users can get hands-on with a virtual weaving loom
  - Learn about the history of weaving and the process of weaving
  - Resources on modern Native American weaving and modern artists
- Quilting
  - Similar to the weaving experience, but specifically the shapes formed on woven quilts
  - History, meaning of certain shapes
  - Modern usage and artists
